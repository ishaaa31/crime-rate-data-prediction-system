# crime-rate-data-prediction-system

ABOUT THIS PROJECT:

Crime is a violation of humanity, often punishable by law. Criminology is a study of crime, interdisciplinary science that investigates and investigates crime and criminal performance data. Criminal activity is now high and the police department is responsible for controlling and reducing criminal activity. 

There has been tremendous increase in machine learning algorithms that have made crime prediction feasible based on past data. The aim of this project is to perform analysis and prediction of crimes in states using machine learning models. It focuses on creating a model that can help to detect the number of crimes by its type in a particular state.

In this project various machine learning models like linear regression, boosted decision trees will be used to predict crimes. Various visualization techniques and plots are used which can help law enforcement agencies to detect and predict crimes with higher accuracy. 
This will indirectly help reduce the rates of crimes and can help to improve securities in such required areas.

DATA ANALYSIS:

The dataset is in a tabular form and includes chronological, geographical and text data and contains incidents derived from the SFPD Crime Incident Reporting system.

More specifically it includes the following variables.

Dates - timestamp of the crime incident

Category - category of the crime incident. (This is our target variable.)

Descript - detailed description of the crime incident

DayOfWeek - the day of the week

PdDistrict - the name of the Police Department DistricT

Address - the approximate street address of the crime incident

X - Longitude
Y - Latitude

CONCLUSION:
In this system, we get to classify and cluster to improve the accuracy of location and pattern-based crimes. From the clustered results it is easy to identify crime prone areas and can be used to design precaution methods for future.

The classification of data is mainly used to distinguish types of preventive measures to be used for each crime. Different crimes require different treatment and it can be achieved easily using this application.
